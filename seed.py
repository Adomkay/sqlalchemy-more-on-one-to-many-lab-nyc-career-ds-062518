# below we are reading the csv files to create the data we will need to create the players
# pandas returns a DataFrame object from reading the CSV
# we then tell the DataFrame object to turn each row into dictionaries
# by giving to_dict the argument "orient='records'"
# we are telling our DataFrame to make each row a dictionary using the column headers
# as the keys for the key value pairs in each new dictionary
# feel free to uncomment lines 18-21 to see each step of the process in your terminal

# la_dodgers0 = pd.read_csv('la_dodgers_baseball.csv')
# la_dodgers1 = pd.read_csv('la_dodgers_baseball.csv').to_dict()
# la_dodgers2 = pd.read_csv('la_dodgers_baseball.csv').to_dict(orient='records')

# now that we have the data for each player
# add and commit the players, teams, sports and cities below
# we will need to probably write at least one function to iterate over our data and create the players
# hint: it may be a good idea to creat the Teams, Cities, and Sports first
